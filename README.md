# Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - Dishonest Casino Analysis

## Overview
This assignement is a part of our coursework at FSU which implements key algorithms for analyzing sequences generated by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the "Dishonest Casino" model. The dataset consists of a sequence of dice rolls, where each roll could have been generated by either a fair die or a loaded die. The objective is to infer the most likely sequence of states (fair or loaded) using probabilistic methods.

## Dataset
The dataset `hmm_pb1.csv` contains a sequence of dice rolls represented as numerical values. Each roll is generated by one of two possible states:
- **Fair Die (State 1)**: A normal six-sided die with equal probability for each number.
- **Loaded Die (State 2)**: A biased die with uneven probabilities for different numbers.

The challenge is to determine when the casino switched between fair and loaded dice based on the observed sequence of rolls.

## Tasks Implemented
### 1. Viterbi Algorithm (Most Likely State Sequence)
The Viterbi algorithm is implemented to determine the most probable sequence of states (fair or loaded) that generated the observed sequence of dice rolls. This method uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the most likely state path.

**Output:**
- A sequence of 1’s and 2’s, where:
  - **1** represents the fair die
  - **2** represents the loaded die

### 2. Forward and Backward Algorithms (State Probabilities)
These algorithms are used to compute the probability of being in each state at each time step. To prevent numerical underflow (very small values causing computation issues), a common scaling factor is used.

**Key Results Reported:**
- The ratio of probabilities for state 1 vs. state 2 at time step **t = 138**:
  - **Forward Algorithm Ratio** (probability of being in each state given the observed sequence up to time 138)
  - **Backward Algorithm Ratio** (probability of observing the remaining sequence given that the state at time 138 is known)

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset `hmm_pb1.csv` from Canvas and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the script to compute:
   - The most likely sequence of states using the Viterbi algorithm
   - The forward and backward probability ratios at time step 138
3. The results will be printed and can be used for verification.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.7)
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Applications
Understanding Hidden Markov Models and their applications is crucial in various fields such as:
- Speech recognition
- Biological sequence analysis
- Fraud detection
- Time series modeling

This assignment demonstrates how probabilistic models can be used to infer hidden states from observed data.
